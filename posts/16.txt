# The Essentiality of Art: Embracing Beauty and Challenging Extremes

--Important-- --Art--

## Introduction:
Art has been an intrinsic part of human existence since time immemorial. Beyond its aesthetic allure, art holds a deeper significance that goes beyond mere decoration or entertainment. It speaks to our evolutionary need for beauty and the enrichment of our souls. However, in today's society, the extreme utilitarianism dominating architecture and the controversial assertions of modern art threaten to undermine the profound impact and transformative power of true artistic expression. This article aims to shed light on the importance of art, challenge the notions of extreme utilitarianism and the overextension of the definition of art, and explore the significance of beauty in our lives.

## The Evolutionary Need for Beauty:
As human beings, we possess an innate desire for beauty. It is a fundamental aspect of our evolutionary development. Throughout history, art has played a crucial role in providing us with a sense of wonder, inspiration, and emotional connection. Beauty transcends utility; it elevates our spirits, stimulates creativity, and fosters a deeper understanding of the world and ourselves. The appreciation of beauty, whether in nature or through artistic expressions, is an essential part of our well-being and contributes to our overall happiness.

## The Pitfalls of Extreme Utilitarianism:
While utilitarianism has its merits, the extreme prioritization of functionality over aesthetics in modern architecture risks diminishing the human experience. Structures devoid of beauty and artistic integrity fail to uplift and inspire. Utilitarianism should not be pursued at the expense of the human spirit and the creation of spaces that nourish our senses and emotions. A harmonious balance between functionality and aesthetics is vital to create environments that enhance our quality of life.

## The Boundaries of Art:
In recent times, there has been a blurring of the boundaries when it comes to defining art. The assertion that "anything can be art" may undermine the significance and impact of genuine artistic expression. Art should be thought-provoking, skillfully crafted, and imbued with meaning. When the definition of art becomes so expansive that it encompasses anything and everything, it dilutes the power and purpose of artistic creation. By preserving the notion that art requires intention, skill, and the ability to evoke emotions, we can ensure the continued relevance and impact of true artistic endeavors.

## The Reclamation of Beauty:
Modern art movements have challenged traditional notions of beauty, often embracing the unconventional and subverting established norms. While this exploration is essential for artistic progression, it is crucial not to dismiss the inherent value of beauty itself. Beauty has the power to uplift, inspire, and bring joy to our lives. Attempts to invert the meaning of beauty and glorify the ugly risk disregarding the positive impact that beauty has on our well-being. It is possible to appreciate the unconventional while still acknowledging and cherishing the timeless allure of beauty.

## The Importance of Health and Well-being:
Look, let's be real here. Body positivity is just a dangerous movement that promotes unhealthy lifestyles. Celebrating obesity as beautiful is nothing short of delusional. Obesity leads to numerous health issues like heart disease, diabetes, and even premature death. Just look at the statistics and you'll see the reality: higher body fat percentage correlates with increased health risks. Take the case of famous plus-size models who die young due to weight-related complications. It's a clear example that fat isn't beautiful, it's a ticking time bomb that can destroy lives. We should prioritize health and fitness over promoting dangerous ideals that harm individuals in the long run. It's time to face the harsh truth and encourage people to take control of their health rather than sugarcoating the reality. 

## Conclusion
Art, beauty, and the celebration of human creativity have always been integral to our existence. They enrich our lives, uplift our spirits, and provide a means for self-expression and connection. The extreme utilitarianism prevalent in architecture and the oversimplification of art challenge the transformative power and impact of true artistic expression. By appreciating the evolutionary need for beauty, understanding the importance of balance, preserving the boundaries of art, and valuing health and well-being, we can ensure that art continues to inspire new generations.
